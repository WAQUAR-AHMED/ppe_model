# Custom ByteTrack config — tuned to reduce ID switching
# Based on ultralytics 8.4.17 bytetrack.yaml schema

tracker_type: bytetrack

track_high_thresh: 0.45   # raised (was 0.25) — only confident detections used for primary match
track_low_thresh: 0.1     # same — used for recovering lost tracks with weak detections
new_track_thresh: 0.5     # raised (was 0.25) — avoid spawning tracks from noisy detections
track_buffer: 90          # raised (was 30) — keeps lost person alive for 3s at 30fps (occlusion tolerance)
match_thresh: 0.65        # lowered (was 0.8) — stricter spatial overlap required before re-assigning ID
fuse_score: True          # fuse detection confidence with IoU for more stable matching
